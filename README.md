# Plutus Pioneer Program Cohort 3
> Plutus Pioneer notes & contracts

This repo covers the (Cohort 3) Plutus Pioneer Program's week to week assignments'; my notes on each of the subjects, my current understanding of the content and context as a whole, and the smart contract examples for each of the lessons.

# My Initial how & WTF's?
> If you understand all these, congrats

The EUTxO model, Monads, on/off chain implementation, minting policies, state machines, Plutus Application Framework (PAF), and Plutus Application Backend (PAB)

# Week 1

Covered the installation and setup of nix-shell for the Plutus development environment.
- https://nixos.org/download.html (Links to an external site.)
- https://docs.plutus-community.com
- Built basic contract for English Auction, started Playground server, and Playground client (in another nix-shell).
- To skip the environment setup process and just test scripts - there is a server hosted by the internal IOG team: https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/
- Play around with English Auction Script.
